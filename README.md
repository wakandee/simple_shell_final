Semicolon(;) - serves as a command seperator that enables the execution of multiple commands on a single line by placing the semicolon between each command.
Harsh - Using a word starting with a harsh symbol in a CLI, designates the rest of the characters on that line as a comment, causing them to be ignored when the command is executed.
